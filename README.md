# Bachelor Thesis: Couplings and Poincaré inequality for Markov chains


Abstract: In most applications of Markov chains, a key question is quantifying the speed of convergence towards the stationary distribution. The aim of this report is to explore two fundamental approaches to this problem. The first, more probabilistic, is based on the notion of coupling and makes use of transport distances, in particular the Wasserstein distance. The second, more analytical in spirit, establishes exponential convergence in an L^2 setting and lead to a Poincaré inequality. Concrete examples are given throughout, including for instance the n-dimensional hypercube, to explore the potential applications of the proven results. Moreover, in the second half of this report, a special effort will be devoted to find a lower bound for the Ricci curvature of reversible Markov chains. Finally, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods will be studied to approximate stationary distributions.
