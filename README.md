# Bachelor Thesis: Couplings and Poincaré inequality for Markov chains


Abstract: In most applications of Markov chains, a key issue is to quantify the speed of convergence to the invariant distribution. The objective of this report is to explore two fundamental approaches to this problem. The first one, more probabilistic, is based on the notion of coupling and makes use of transport distances, in particular the Wasserstein distance. The second one, more analytical in spirit, establishes exponential convergence in an L2 setting and leads to a Poincaré inequality. Concrete examples are given throughout the report, including the n-dimensional hypercube, in order to explore the potential applications of the proven results. In the second half of this report, a particular effort will be devoted to finding a lower bound for the Ollivier Ricci curvature of reversible Markov chains. Finally, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method will be studied to approximate invariant distributions.
